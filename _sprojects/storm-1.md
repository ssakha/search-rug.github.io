Rascal is a language workbench and environment for source code analysis and transformation. One library component of Rascal is *M3* a general model to represent facts about source code. It includes information on files, classes, ASTs, name binding, type relations, containment, and optionally inheritance, call graphs etc. Currently, the model has been instantiated for Java, Javascript, and CSharp. The goal of this project is provide an M3 bridge to the Ethereum Solidity language. This will enable analysis and reverse engineering of Smart Contracts running on the Ethereum blockchain.
