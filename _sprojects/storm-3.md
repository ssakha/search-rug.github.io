DESCRIPTION
Salix is a framework in Rascal for defining immediate mode, web-based UIs. It follows the Elm model where an application is defined using a view function and an model update function.

Salix is an extensible framework, and currently features "embeddings" of "foreign" Javascript components, like CodeMirror, xterm.js, dagre-d3 and Google Charts. The goal of this project is to investigate how to embed Web-based diagram editor frameworks into the Salix model for defining UIs.
