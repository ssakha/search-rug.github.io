DESCRIPTION
Fairness (and its opposite unfairness) plays a role in any process where decisions that affect others are made. For instance, unfairness negatively influences employee satisfaction and team performance at work. The problem gets critical in modern software projects, that rely on a global and diverse workforce more susceptible to unfairness.

Join us in understanding the many ways in which development activities are unfair, the extent of the problem, and solutions to mitigate it. There are many interesting research problems here that will need software engineering and artificial intelligence-based solutions.
