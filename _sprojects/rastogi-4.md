DESCRIPTION
Do you want to graduate in a larger project together with other researchers? And perform research at several SMEs? And do you want to dive into the backgrounds of new, innovative digital technology? Then do your graduation assignment at the 'Digital innovation in SMEs' program, a collaboration of three Universities of Applied Sciences, two universities and a consortium of SME organizations.

In Q4 2022 we will start the research project 'Exploratory Study on Emerging Digital Technologies in SMEs'. In the project, researchers and students from different universities collaborate with practitioners from SMEs in a series of case studies in which the current state of affairs regarding emerging digital technologies – such as Industry 4.0, Internet-of-Things, AI, machine learning, big data analytics and robotics – is being explored.

Potential research may include:

1. Initial research question: “What factors affect the use of emerging digital technologies (such as IoT, AI, machine learning, big data analytics and robotics) in SMEs?”

2. The study includes fixed conceptualization and research design, but students are free to explore other subtopics.
