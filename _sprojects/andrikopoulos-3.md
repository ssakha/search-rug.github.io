# Establishing the Environmental Footprint of Chatbots

This project aims to investigate what is the environmental footprint of training and using chatbots. For this purpose, an open source chatbot will be used as a reference, its energy consumption on a reference machine will be established for both training and use, and the results will be used for establishing a benchmark.

More information by contacting the supervisor. *This project is intended for MSc students only due to its complexity; it can be converted into a BSc project but it can only be done as a group*.
